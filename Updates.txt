Used a thing called django-imagekit for photo editing, but it doesn't work very well. Not sure if it can be fixed or if we'll need to try something else. 
It seems that the user upload works OK. 
Broke the re-direct after a user creates an account somehow. 
Also, before you to run ' pip install -r image_space/requirements.pip ' again as I added some.
